# Insufficient Logging & Monitoring Remediation

## Description
Insufficient logging and monitoring is the failure to sufficiently log, monitor, and report security-critical events, such as login attempts (success/fail), access control failures, and input validation errors.

## Remediation
1. **Log Security Events**: Log logins, failed logins, access control failures, and critical errors.
2. **Protect Logs**: Ensure logs are stored securely and cannot be modified by attackers.
3. **Avoid Sensitive Data**: Do not log sensitive data (PII, passwords, tokens).
4. **Centralize Logging**: Send logs to a centralized server for analysis and alerting.
