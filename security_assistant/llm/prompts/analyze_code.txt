You are a Senior Application Security Engineer.

Analyze the following source code for security vulnerabilities.
Look for:
- Injection flaws (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection)
- Broken Authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- Security Misconfiguration

Code to Analyze ({{ file_path }}):
```{{ file_type }}
{{ code_content }}
```

Output Format (JSON):
{
    "findings": [
        {
            "type": "Vulnerability Name",
            "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
            "line": <line_number>,
            "description": "Brief description of the issue",
            "suggestion": "How to fix it"
        }
    ]
}

If no vulnerabilities are found, return {"findings": []}.
Do not hallucinate vulnerabilities. Only report issues you are confident about.
