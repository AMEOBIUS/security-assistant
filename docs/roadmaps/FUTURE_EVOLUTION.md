# 🚀 Future Evolution: Security Assistant v2.1+

This document outlines the strategic vision for the post-v2.0 evolution of the Security Assistant platform.

## 🌟 Strategic Pillars

1.  **Enterprise Readiness**: Moving from "developer tool" to "enterprise platform".
2.  **Cloud Native**: Native integration with cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, K8s).
3.  **Autonomous Security**: Shifting from "Human-in-the-loop" to "Human-on-the-loop" for trusted fixes.
4.  **Supply Chain Integrity**: Securing not just the code, but the entire delivery pipeline.

    *   Container image scanning registry integration.
    *   Admission controller webhook.

### Phase 3: Advanced AI & Autonomy (v2.3)
*Focus: Autonomous Agents*

*   **Session 96: Autonomous Remediation Agent**
    *   Self-healing infrastructure.
    *   Auto-patching of non-breaking dependencies.
    *   "Human-on-the-loop" approval workflows.
