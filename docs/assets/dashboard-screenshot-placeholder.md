# Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the dashboard screenshot.

## To add the screenshot:

1. Run a scan:
   ```bash
   security-assistant scan examples/vulnerable_code.py
   ```

2. Open the HTML report:
   ```bash
   start security-reports/report.html  # Windows
   open security-reports/report.html   # macOS
   ```

3. Take a screenshot (zoom to 80-90%)

4. Save as `dashboard-screenshot.png` in this directory

5. Update README.md to uncomment the image line

## Alternative: Use a demo image

You can use a mockup or create a simple diagram showing:
- Summary cards (Total, Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Vulnerability table with KEV/Reachability badges
- Expanded finding with remediation advice

Tools: Figma, Canva, or even PowerPoint
